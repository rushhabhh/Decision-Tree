# Pet Adoption Likelihood Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of pet adoption based on various attributes using machine learning techniques. It serves as a practical application of classification models in the domain of animal welfare and adoption analytics.

## Overview

The objective is to identify factors that influence whether a pet is adopted or not and to build a model that can predict adoption likelihood from structured data.

## Project Link

The complete workflow is documented in the following Jupyter Notebook:

## Project Features

- **Data Loading**: Importing structured pet profile data (e.g., age, breed, color, health conditions).
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical features
  - Feature scaling if required
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding trends and patterns in adoption.
- **Model Building**:
  - Logistic Regression (or other classifiers depending on the notebook)
  - Training and test splitting
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix heatmap and performance insights.

## Dataset

The dataset includes attributes such as:

- Pet Age  
- Type and Breed  
- Health and Vaccination Status  
- Description and Gender  
- Adoption Outcome (target)

Each record provides key information to assess adoption probability.

## Key Findings

- Certain features like pet type, breed, and health status strongly influence adoption.
- The trained model demonstrates good predictive performance on unseen data.
- Visualization of model results supports actionable insights for improving adoption campaigns.
